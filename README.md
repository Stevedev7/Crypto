# Cryptography project (16CSE54)

# About project
Enhanced **[Simplified Data Encryption Standard Algorithm](https://www.brainkart.com/article/Simplified-Data-Encryption-Standard-(S-DES)_8343/)** to
protect data and to provide Security to the data.ESDES Algorithm
uses number of operations and rounds applied to blocks. It
computes complement operation when text is converted from
ASCII to binary. Large Number is Decomposed to achieve parallel
processing of bits. Adding 1â€™s complement operations gives
additional security and making it difficult for the intruder to
attack. As the complexity is increased the encryption and
decryption time is also increased.

## Requirements
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) latest version
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) latest version
1. Text editor

## Clone project

```bin\bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Stevedev7/Crypto.git
$ npm init
```

## Run

### Encryption

1. Open terminal
1. Move into the project folder
1. Make a file and type the message to be encrypted
1. Run the following command

```bin\bash
$ node fileEncrypt.js 'inputFileName' 'OutputFileName' 'key'
```

### Decryption

1. Open terminal
1. Move into the project folder
1. Make a file and type the message to be encrypted
1. Run the following command

```bin\bash
$ node fileDecrypt.js 'inputFileName' 'OutputFileName' 'key'
```
